<h2>Google Keep Clone</h2>

To run the application, open it using a live server extension like Live Server for VS Code. Then, run the following command in the terminal: <b>tsc script.ts</b>.

To start the JSON server, run <b>json-server --watch notes.json</b>.

Note that there is a known issue where if there are notes saved in the JSON file and the application is closed and reopened, the images may not be displayed correctly. I have tried various solutions, but have not been able to resolve the issue yet.
